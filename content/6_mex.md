What is mentioned in regards to Data & Ethics in the Mexican AI Strategy are mere recommendations on what the Government/The “Office of AI” should do in regard to these topics rather than real commitments.

So in order to create a data infrastructure that allows Mexico the best possible advantage of the benefits of AI, it is recommended that the government should: 
1. Update the legal framework with respect to personal data in order to promote greater access considering privacy protection and ethical criteria
2. Accelerate access to the greatest quantity of data in a way that respects ethics and privacy.
3. Drive standardization of data in public databases, e.g., based on the international Open Data Charter
	
Regarding ethics following recommendations are foreseen:
1. Create a specialized independent body that protects and monitors human rights related to developing and implementing AI in Mexico, with support from academia and different interest groups (known in the future as the “Mexican AI Ethics Council”)
2. Establish minimum standards (technical and non-technical) and auditing mechanisms for these standards. Technical standards should include clear, robust and valid metrics for AI systems in order to reduce and identify errors and biases. The non-technical standards should include but not be limited to transparency and easily explainable AI systems, e.g., requiring risk disclosure and potential negative impacts of AI systems on research
3. Incentivize the creation of independent organizations that can monitor and audit AI systems
4. Promote the development and ethical use of AI
5. Create practical tools to support the adoption of international guidelines on the ethical use of AI
6. Promote the inclusion of minorities and vulnerable groups in projects and institutions dedicated to topics related to AI
