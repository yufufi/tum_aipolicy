## China

The role of the government in steering China'sAI strategy can be said to reflect its contemporary economy model, mixing both central planning features driven by the state and market-based features driven by the private sector.

Before the release of the "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (AIDP), the importance of AI had already been included in the "Made in China 2025" grand plan and the 13th Five-Year-Plan announced by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's (CCP). Therefore, putting the AIDP into China's broader policy context, it should be seen as a key strategic area that closely supports many of the structural transitions that the government is involved in from its central role in steering, through spelling out specific reforms, standards and setting numerical targets[^38].

However, while the AIDP will be guided by a new AI Strategy Advisory Committee and coordinated by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MIST), the AIDP has been suggested to serve more as central guidance instead of a centrally managed initiative. Much of the actual innovation and transformation is expected to be driven by the private sector and local governments.[^39]

One example is the Chinese government's announcement of private-sector partnerships in supporting the AIDP. In 2017, China's Ministry of Science and Technology announced a partnership model with national tech giants[^40]. Four companies were called upon to leverage their strengths in four AI fields to support "technology, economy, social development and national security":

-   Baidu is tasked with the development for autonomous driving
-   Alibaba is tasked with the development of urban brains (smart )
-   Tencent is tasked with the development of computer vision for imaging
-   iFLYTEK (partially state-owned) is tasked with the development of intelligence

When compared with public-private partnership in other countries, one can argue that this form of "national champion endorsement" still reflects the more top-down commanding role of the Chinese government.  Local governments are incentivised under China's political structure to fulfill centrally-defined initiatives, but the broad range of the AIDP may also give rise to individual development paths across provinces, as local governments may prioritize different AI projects, with different stakeholders, most suited to their contexts.
