## Japan

Japan outlines four strategic goals that reflect its integrated view of connecting AI development and the social mechanisms that play an enabling role.[^36]

1) AI talent pool: to develop a world-leading human resources base aligned with the diverse needs of the AI era and attractive for global talents. As the needs of the AI era are broad, the Japanese government emphasizes that such human resources are not a uniform type of person, but should cover people working in research, who apply AI to industry and in small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), and who use AI to create new business, including women and people from overseas.

2) AI industry competitiveness: to become a frontrunner in applying AI to real-world industry and strengthen industrial competitiveness. Japan defines "real world industry" as the domain involving interactions among people, nature, hardware, etc, and aims to measure its industry competitiveness by labor productivity level, a benchmark which it hopes to match those of the US, Germany and France before 2030.  

3) AI-related diverse technology systems: to implement AI mechanisms to realize a "sustainable society that incorporates diversity". Japan envisions using AI to create social systems that enable women, foreigners, elderly people and people with diverse backgrounds to fully participate in society while enjoying diverse lifestyles, both within Japan's borders and on a global scale.

4) AI leadership: to take a leadership role in AI international research, education, and social infrastructure networks. Japan sets the target of international partnerships and collaboration in areas of joint R&D, human resource development and the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

To realize the four strategic goals, Japan's AI strategy further identified two areas of foundational work: 1) Education and R&D reform, and 2) implementing AI for industry and society through five priority areas: (i) healthcare; (ii) agriculture; (iii) national resilience in relation to natural disasters; (iv) transportation infrastructure and logistics; and (v) regional revitalization (smart cities). These initiatives are to be supported by a policy to improve data infrastructure, digital government and support for SMEs.
