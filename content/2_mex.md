The key vision that the Mexican Government has in regards to their AI Strategy is aiming to be a global leader in AI and digitalisation, and as such being capable of promoting social and economic development for its citizens.

In Mexico, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of the economy, generating 72% of employment and contributing to 52% of the country’s GDP. One of the main goals is to digitize those and allow them to identify through Big Data, data analytics and AI new business opportunities, gain access to global markets and create a better understanding of their overall business environment.
Through the usage of AI systems, the government also aims to automate routine tasks which currently occupy a large amount of many peoples’ working days, leaving them free to focus on more complex, high-level tasks which cannot yet be effectively performed by machines. This encourages human creativity and innovation, aspects that can increase productivity and solve partly the economic stagnation Mexico is living through.
Beyond that, future uses of AI may also enable cheaper, and more tailored, public services such as health and education. As such, one of the major goals of the Government is also to provide greater access to high-quality healthcare and schooling for the population.. 

Concluding, the Mexican Government and experts in all sectors are committed to promoting AI in the country in a sustainable and scalable way, primarily focusing on the social impact it can have and the opportunities it offers in providing better living conditions for the Mexican population.
