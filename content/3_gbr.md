## The United Kingdom

The high level goal of the United Kingdom is "to put the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and data revolution". Each of 5 foundations of productivity also has separate goals:

1.  Ideas: Become the most innovative economy
2.  People: Generate good jobs, achieve greater earning power.
3.  Infrastructure: Have a major upgrade
4.  Business Environment: Be best place to start and grow a business
5.  Places: Secure prosperous communities across the UK

Embedding AI across the UK will create thousands of good quality jobs and drive economic growth. A recent study found digital technologies including AI created a net total of 80,000 new jobs annually across a population similar to the UK20. By one estimate, AI could add Â£232bn to the UK economy by 2030.

Meeting the Grand Challenge means maximising the opportunities created by AI and advanced data technologies, and responding to the potential impacts on society. Britain wants to be among the first countries to ensure that everyone benefits from this revolution, make the UK a global centre for artificial intelligence and data-driven innovation and support sectors to boost their productivity through artificial intelligence and data analytic technologies.

On top the UK wants to lead the world in safe and ethical use of data and artificial intelligence giving confidence and clarity to citizens and business and help people develop the skills needed for jobs of the future.
