## Mexico

The role of the government in the creation/implementation of the AI Strategy may differ significantly between Mexico and other countries as the willingness to push forward the topic of AI in the country rather comes from the civil society, academics and the private sector[^43].

In spring 2018 Mexico had a change of administration, and much of the work from the government around digitalisation took a halt with a shift in policy priorities. As such many stakeholders that took part in the creation of the national AI Strategy stressed the importance of creating an independent body to oversee the implementation and coordination of both digitalisation and AI policies to ensure continuity[^44].

The Mexican strategy clearly defines the role the government should take in order to ensure the successful implementation of the AI strategy:[^45]: 

1.  First the government should set a clear strategic direction. A cross-cutting, central government department should own the national AI strategy - "Office of AI" and an official to lead AI should be appointed.
2.  As AI is a cross-cutting technology and touches on almost every area of governance, either through government support, promotion or in delivery, selected ministries should appoint Emergent Technology Innovation teams to lead individual efforts.
3.  Governments have enormous power to change the national conversation and direct attention. The Mexican government should harness this power to champion Mexico as a strategic place to build and deploy AI technology e.g. through supporting the creation of an AI chamber of commerce, actively attracting the best talent to return or come to work in Mexico and ensuring that stories of successful Mexican AI deployments are shared internationally
4.  Develop guidelines for smart AI procurement by
    a.  Talking to the emergent Mexican AI sector to foster mutual understanding and stimulate ideas on how AI could help the government provide better services for less.

    b.  Take a portfolio approach to develop and procure AI products and services in government.

Other important AI government actions included the publication of two key documents related to the responsible and ethical development and use of AI (AI General Principles & a Risk Assessment Tool for the use of autonomous systems). Both were opened for public participation in their development.[^46]

The development of the Mexican AI Strategy was (and still continues to be) a bottom-up approach. The process of developing the national AI Strategy was chaired by the organization C Minds, and six further working groups that were established around several key topics mentioned in the strategy (e.g. Ethics, Data, R&D etc.). Key Mexican institutions from all sectors helped lead each working group including the Mexican Society of AI, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economy, the Telecommunications Federal Institute, Plenum Group, the National University of Mexico, the National Mathematics Institute, among others, bringing their expertise and different points of view into the efforts.

Another example of the necessity of bringing different perspectives in, and the favoring of a bottom-up approach, is the multi-stakeholder national coalition named IA2030.mx which is formed by institutions from the industry, civil society, academy and government. Its objective is to coordinate efforts, build a single voice around AI and promote continued action and support for the topic. What started as a collaboration of ten institutions grew to more than 110 on a national scale. One of the first actions of the coalition was launching a national consultation on AI, where more than 1,500 people shared their perspectives.
