The UK government has published “a guide to using artificial intelligence in the public sector” is meant to be a guideline for AI based projects. It covers everything from evaluating AI as a potential tool for some project to management/maintenance and ethics. The Ethics section is a summary of the Alan Turing Institute’s guidance.

There are three new bodies founded:

AI Council: Expert committee from academia and business.
Office for AI: Follows up on the implementation of UK’s AI strategy.
Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation: identifies measures needed to make sure the development of AI is safe, ethical and innovative.

The UK also has a Data Ethics Framework. The goal is stated as: “The Data Ethics Framework guides appropriate and responsible data use in government and the wider public sector. It helps public servants understand ethical considerations, address these within their projects, and encourages responsible innovation.”

The report “Artificial Intelligence and Public Standards” argues that the area of “transparency and data bias” requires urgent guidance and regulation. Otherwise it is suggested that existing institutions are “commendable” and the UK does not need a new AI regulator.

The UK also has set up a fund named “Regulator’s Pioneer Fund” to help regulators promote latest regulator practices when developing emerging tech.
