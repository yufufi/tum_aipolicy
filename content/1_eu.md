In Europe AI strategies are split between national efforts such as in Germany or France and the push for a common, supranational, AI strategy on a European level that has been published  in 2018. As part of its AI Strategy, the European Commission has joined forces with all Member States, Norway and Switzerland to foster the development and application of AI in Europe..

Through streamlining research and collaboration between Member States and increasing investment into AI development and deployment as well as building out policy options for a future EU regulatory framework, with a particular focus on high-risk applications the European Union hopes to leverage itâ€™s common market and regulatory frameworks to guide developments against a background of global competition. . 

In its Strategy on Artificial Intelligence, the European Commission lays out a three part vision for AI in Europe.

(1) Place Europe ahead of technological developments and encourage the uptake of AI by the public and private sectors. 
(2) Prepare Europe for the socio-economic changes that wide AI adoption will bring. 
(3) Establish appropriate ethical and legal frameworks for the development and operations of AI. 

In order to manage the safety and liability of AI development and operations, the strategy builds upon the foundations of the Report on the Safety and Liability Aspects of AI and the European Data Strategy.
