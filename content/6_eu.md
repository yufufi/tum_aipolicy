# The European Union

The European Union's efforts to regulate Artificial Intelligence are set around a collaboration between streamlining research efforts, fostering collaboration between Member states and increasing investment into AI development and deployment. At the same time the EU is developing a regulatory framework to determine which requirements relevant actors will have to fulfill, especially looking at high-risk applications.

Furthermore, the EU has been leading the field of data protection with the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rising to particular prominence. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the EU's approach to ethics and data protection has been at the forefront of the debate on AI in Europe. Through the European data strategy as well as the Report on the safety and liability aspects of AI the EU is advancing it's vision that freely available non-personal data should empower
everyone to make better decisions.[^60][^61]
