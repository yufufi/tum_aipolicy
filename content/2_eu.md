# European Union

The European vision for developing an AI strategy is to utilize a split approach of regulation and investment to promote the development of AI and address the risks associated with certain use cases of AI.

In order to increase the development and uptake of AI in the public and private sector the Commission sets out to strengthen the collaboration of different research centres on Artificial Intelligence across Europe.  Through linking individual efforts from public and private institutions they hope to increase the impact of the individual parts. In order to further accelerate this process the commission has been supporting the development of the "AI-on-demand platform" that provides access to a vast amount of AI resources in the EU.

Through creating large scale testing and experimentation facilities in key strategic sectors and technologies the Commission hopes to increase the deployment and uptake of AI and robotics made in Europe starting with a focus on AI adoption in the public sector to transform public procurement processes themselves.

Beyond investing into public and private research and development efforts the Commission also acknowledges that Education needs to be rethought in the wake of expanding AI and automation efforts. Through expanding the upskilling of the existing workforce as part of the Digital Education Action plan 2021-2027 and the Digital Europe Programme the EU wants to advance digital skills.[^26]
