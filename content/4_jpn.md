## Japan

Japan's AI Strategy identifies the government as the "overall coordinator"[^42] and leaves the implementation to private sector companies, which must all comply with the "Social Principles of Human-Centric AI".

Therefore, the role of the Japanese government lies in establishing and maintaining an enabling environment in the technological, economic and social dimension. This ranges from laying down the foundational support in data infrastructure, human resources and R&D, to promoting social acceptance of AI, by developing cybersecurity and ethical standards and improving AI literacy.

A specific section in Japan's AI Strategy is dedicated to role-sharing between the government and the private sector. The government positions itself as the maintainer of an environment most supportive to private sector efforts, through specific actions such as:

-   Developing the AI strategy and implementation roadmap
-   Immediately removing institutional and policy obstacles
-   Developing domestic and foreign human resources
-   Putting measures in place for social structure transformation related to AI
-   Forming governance systems and ethics framework for AI
-   Building multi-stakeholder networks and hubs

It's worth noting that Japan's AI strategy also includes transforming the government itself into an "AI Era Digital Government". Considering Japan's delay in computerization in the public services sector and aging population, which have increased the administrative costs of local governments, Japan's AI Strategy also aims to utilize AI to make public services more cost-efficient and policy planning more precise.
