# Overview

Everything points to the existence of more than one (AI Strategy) model: in parts of Asia, States how these technologies are designed and deployed, to facilitating as an ecosystem coordinator. In North America a laissez-faire approach focuses on how the private sector develops and uses AI, with minimum involvement from the State. In Europe it is taking the shape of a mixed approach, focused mainly on a strong regulatory framework enforced by the State, and implemented through big techs and SMEs. In Latin America, same as in Africa and Southeast Asia, this is still an open question.[^5] Countries in these regions have to decide whether they will lead or fall into an umbrella of others, and in that case if they are forced to follow with no or minimum voice on how AI will transform their governments and societies.

## Why we need AI Strategies

AI is used in many of our daily lives activities like mobility, retail, hospitality and will increasingly be used in areas such as social programs, security and finance. Along with concrete uses of these technologies there are relevant questions that remain to be answered, for example regarding data protection, regulation and bias, ethical issues around algorithmic accountability, openness, and transparency and so on. These are only some of the questions that make the need for national and local AI strategies relevant, since the path governments decide to follow today will define their place in an increasingly AI driven global space.
