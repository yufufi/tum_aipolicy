The UK considers Artificial Intelligence and data as one of the Great Challenges of its Industrial Strategy. High level goal is “to put the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and data revolution.”
 
Like the Industrial Strategy, overall approach is built on top of the 5 foundations (of productivity):
 
Ideas: Increase R&D investment (part of the aforementioned industrial strategy, not just for AI) to make the UK the world’s most innovative economy.
 
People: Increase the supply of skills working with universities and industry. 
 
Infrastructure: Invest in digital infrastructure (i.e. physical -> e.g. 5g mobile network, full-fibre broadband) Solve (cultural and practical) problems around data sharing (both private and public) to improve availability of data.
 
Business Environment: Make the UK “the best place to start and grow a business”. As part of the deal the UK will establish a new AI Council (with members from respected leaders from both academia and industry), a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation”. Also take steps to attract AI entrepreneurs to the UK. 
 
Places: Overall goal is to help communities prosper. London is considered (by the report itself) to be the European capital of AI. There are clusters across the country (e.g. Edinburgh, Cambridge etc) Government will support these clusters.
