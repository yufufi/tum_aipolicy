China's "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan"[^55] (AIDP) outlined specific targets for China to become a world leader in setting ethical norms and standards for AI.

The document, however, included mostly high-level direction for further research and development in a broad range of ethical and regulatory topics, such as "civil and criminal responsibility confirmation, privacy and property protection, information security utilization". It also called for setting up a traceability and accountability system, and clarification of the legalities of AI such as rights and obligations.

In 2018, China's Standardization Administration, the state body developing technical standards, released a white paper on AI standards which identified three key principles: i) human interests as the ultimate purpose; ii) the principle of liability requires accountability and transparency, iii) the "consistency of rights and responsibilities" principle, which aims to balance data oversight and intellectual property protection in the commercial domain.[^56]

In 2019, China's Ministry of Science and Technology established the National New Generation Artificial Intelligence Governance Expert Committee, which released eight principles for AI governance: harmony and friendliness, fairness and justice, inclusiveness and sharing, respect for privacy, security and controllability, shared responsibility, open cooperation, and agile governance[^57].

China's AIDP named "massive data resources" as one of its unique advantages in AI development. While most of its policy literature on AI regulations emphasize the importance of privacy, scholars have debated exactly what types of personal data are protected, considering China's historically looser data protection regulations when compared to some of the western countries. In 2018, a privacy standard called Personal Information Security Specification was released to elaborate on broad privacy rules, which were established in the 2017 Cyber Security Law[^58]. However, the Specification has been described to function more as a voluntary standard instead of a binding data protection law such as the GDPR in the EU.

In late 2020, a draft of a new personal data protection law was put into consultation process[^59]. Whether it may present any impact on China's AI governance remains to be observed.
