The current efforts by Japan’s government in building a regulatory and governance system for AI can be described in three aspects: ethics principles, specific AI and data guidelines, and data protection regulations.


On a high-level, Japan founded its "Social Principles of Human-Centric AI''. Its three overarching principles are Dignity, Diversity and Inclusion, and Sustainability. Private companies involved in AI development must comply with these principles. Japan is also one of the countries that have adopted the “OECD Principles on AI” announced in 2019. 

On a practical level, Japan recognises that the fundamental ingredient of AI development is large amounts of data, and have formulated several guidelines that address different stakeholders and aspects of AI utilization.

- Japan’s "AI Utilization Guidelines" (2019) advises stakeholders including developers, users, service producers, end users (business and consumer) on what to consider in AI utilization. Ten principles were suggested with regards to data quality, collaboration, safety, security, fairness, privacy, etc.

- Japan’s AI Strategy references the Basic Act on the Advancement of Public and Private Sector Data Utilization, enacted as legislation in 2016, which regulates under which purposes and mechanisms the government and private sector shall coordinate in data utilization. 

- Japan’s AI Strategy also references the “Cyber Physical Security Framework” (2018), which addressed rules and methodologies that ensure trustworthiness of data in cross-sectoral data cooperation. Japan’s AI Strategy plans to build on the framework and develop trust data linkage infrastructure that enable international mutual authentication with the U.S. and Europe.

On a data protection level, Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) was enacted in 2003 and was subsequently amended several times to raise data protection standards. In mid-2020, the APPI was amended to include the rights of data subject to request data deletion, the obligation for data operators to report data breach, stricter oversight on the use of cookies, and including pseudonymised information as a category of personal data (similar to GDPR in the EU). As the new APPI is expected to come into effect in 2022, its potential impacts on AI products and services using personal data are yet to be observed.
