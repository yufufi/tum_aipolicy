In July 2017, China announced its official **"New Generation of
Artificial Intelligence Development Plan"**[^12] **(AIDP)**. The
20,000-word plan directly premised its need for such a strategy by
calling AI a "strategic technology" that presents China with both
opportunities and uncertainties on three fronts: international
competition, economic growth and social construction.

The plan, serving as the first state-level unified AI strategy, was
promulgated by China's State Council, the country's highest-level
administrative authority which formulates top policy measures, prepares
state budget and economic plans, and monitors implementation at all
levels and across ministries. China's AI strategy is structured in six
sections:

1) **"The strategic situation"**, which maps the technological landscape
of AI, its implications and potential for China;
2) **"Overall Requirements"**, which lays out China's guiding
philosophy, principles and strategic goals, such as building a domestic
industry worth almost 1 trillian yuan by 2030;
3) **"Key Tasks"**, which lays out implementation targets such as the
types of AI systems to be improved, the types of emerging industries to
be developed in AI, the embedding of AI in social and safety
infrastructure, and military-civilian integration;
4) **"Allocation of Resources"**, which elaborates the financial means
and coordination of resources;
5) **"Assurance Measures"**, which touches upon the laws, ethical norms
and evaluation systems that need to be considered;
6) **"Organization and Implementation"**, which specifies the role of
the Ministry of Science and Technology, the establishment of the AI
strategy advisory committee and the importance of guiding public
opinion.

Later in 2017, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
(MIIT) published a follow-up "**Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the
Development of New Generation Artificial Intelligence Industry"**[^13],
which built upon the broader strategy. The action plan concretized key
advancement targets to support industrial development for both China's
**AI strategy** and **"Made in China 2025"** strategy, emphasizing the
development of intelligent and networked products, AI's support system
such as smart sensors, intelligent manufacturing, and improvement of the
AI ecosystem including training, testing and cybersecurity.
