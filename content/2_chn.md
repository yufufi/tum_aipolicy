China envisions becoming a world leader in AI theory, technology and application by 2030, with a domestic industry worth more than 1 trillion yuan and the scale of its related industries worth more than 10 trillion yuan. 

While China’s ambition to pursue technological prowess in AI is prevalent in its multiple-decade policy, the AIDP does not only see AI as an industrial innovation, but a “major historical opportunity” that can help the country leapfrog its development and shape its future on mainly three fronts: international competition, economic growth and social governance. 

China identifies AI as a “new focus of international competition” core to advancing its “national competitiveness” and “national security”; a “new engine of economic development” key to its next phase of economic reform by triggering new models of industries and shifts in human production; and finally, a strategic technology for “social construction”, one that can improve the precision level of public service as well as “the ability and level of social governance”.

In general, China’s macro AI vision encompasses its multifaceted aims to “develop intelligent economy, construct intelligent society, safeguard national security”. The AIDP comprehensively covers key initiatives in R&D, industrialization targets, education and personnel training, the potential to become a driving force for the ethics and regulation system of AI, the need for military-civilian integration in accordance with related laws, and the promotion of AI applications, such as biometric identification technology, intelligent security and police products, for “public safety intelligent monitoring”.
