# China

China envisions becoming a world leader in AI theory, technology and application by 2030, with a domestic industry worth more than 1 trillion yuan and the scale of its related industries worth more than 10 trillion yuan[^22].

While China's ambition to pursue technological prowess in AI is prevalent in its multiple-decade policy, the "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (AIDP) does not only see AI as an industrial innovation, but a "major historical opportunity"[^23] that can help the country leapfrog its development and shape its future on mainly three fronts: international competition, economic growth and social governance.

China identifies AI as a "new focus of international competition" core to advancing its "national competitiveness" and "national security"; a "new engine of economic development" key to its next phase of economic reform by triggering new models of industries and shifts in human production; and finally, a strategic technology for "social construction", one that can improve the precision level of public service as well as "the ability and level of social governance"[^24].

In general, China's macro AI vision encompasses its multifaceted aims to "develop intelligent economy, construct intelligent society, safeguard national security". The AIDP comprehensively covers key initiatives in R&D, industrialization targets, education and personnel training, the potential to become a driving force for the ethics and regulation system of AI, the need for military-civilian integration in accordance with related laws, and the promotion of AI applications, such as biometric identification technology, intelligent security and police products, for "public safety intelligent monitoring".[^25]
