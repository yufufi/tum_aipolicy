## Mexico

Mexico decided to set the foundations of AI through three concrete actions: first, analyzing the country's readiness for AI; second, launching its first AI Strategy in 2018; and third, consolidating the AI multi-sector ecosystem.

Mexico's AI Strategy 2018, included five key actions[^37] (goals to be aimed at):

1.  Develop an inclusive governance framework, through the creation of an AI Sub-commission led by the Office of the President, the Ministry of Public Administration, and with official participation of industry, civil society, academia, and some local governments as advisors. This Sub-commission had the objective of setting the of the AI initiative and developing coordinated actions within the National Public Administration and States of Mexico.
2.  Identify the uses and needs of AI in industry, through a documentation exercise carried out by the Mexican Chamber of Telecommunication Industry, as well as identifying best practices within government of AI.
3.  Open the medium and long term recommendations of the Policy Report for public consultation
4.  Support Mexico's AI leadership in international forums, including the OECD, D9, the G20, and by creating the Working Group on Technological Change in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals within the United Nations (UN) and the Working Group for Emerging Technologies in the Latin America and Caribbean Network the Development of Digital Governments (GEALC, its acronym in Spanish).
5.  Promote continuity through changing administrations, by working with all interested stakeholders towards an official AI National Policy

These actions allows Mexico to establish the bases for the leveraging of AI as a tool for social and economic development, a strategy to be further explored and strengthened by academia, the industry and civil society and by the new Administration (2018-2024), which entered office in December 2018.
