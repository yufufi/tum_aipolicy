# European Union

In Europe there are different areas in which AI will have a significant impact. The European Commission sees the application cases in three general areas:

1.  Private sector Citizens - reap new benefits for example improved care, fewer breakdowns of household machinery, safer and cleaner transport systems, better public services
2.  Businesses - a new generation of products and services in areas where Europe is particularly strong (machinery, transport, cybersecurity, farming, the green and circular economy, healthcare and high-value added sectors like fashion and tourism)

3.  Public sector services - reducing the costs of providing services (transport, education, energy and waste management), by improving the sustainability of products and by equipping law enforcement authorities with appropriate tools to ensure the security of citizens, with proper safeguards to respect their rights and freedoms[^50]
