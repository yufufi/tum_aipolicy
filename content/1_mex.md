## Mexico

Considering the advancements other countries were making in regard to developing AI strategies, the Government of Mexico took a proactive approach to the matter and in 2017 decided to catalyze the conversation on the future of AI and the place that the country should take in the international scenario.

The advancements on digitalization, technical infrastructure and open data availability, among others, allowed Mexico to decide to set the foundations of AI through three concrete actions: first, analyzing the country's readiness for AI; second, launching its first AI Strategy in 2018; and third, consolidating the AI multi-sector ecosystem. [^21]

As such, in 2017 the government of Mexico, together with strategic actors from civil society, the private sector, academia, and international cooperation, decided to develop the first AI strategy for the country and Latin America. This report was commissioned by the British Embassy in Mexico and funded by the UK Prosperity Fund. It was developed by Oxford Insights and C Minds with the collaboration of the Mexican Government and input from experts across Mexico.[^22]

Taking this into account, Mexico's AI Strategy is rather the result of a bottom-up effort pushed forward by external players and the civil society rather than solely by the government.
