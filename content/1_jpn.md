Japan is the world’s second country to announce a national AI strategy (after Canada), and the first nation to do so in the Asia-Pacific region. 

In 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe ordered the setup of a special council, which later released the “Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy” in March 2017. This first strategy plan put its focus on promoting AI development in an industrial framework. Taking note of the trend of “Industry 4.0” and Japan’s relatively lower investment in R&D, the plan set an “Industrialization Roadmap” in priority areas including productivity, healthcare, and mobility.

In 2019, Japan released its more comprehensive “AI Strategy 2019: AI for Everyone: People, Industries, Regions and Governments”. This second strategy, at three times the length of the previous plan, represents a more in-depth plan that holistically embeds itself within Japan’s “Society 5.0” plan, a grand strategy that envisions a “human-centric society that can balance economic development and social issues”, while also linking to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

The plan was announced by the Integrated Innovation Strategy Promotion Council under the Cabinet, a cross-disciplinary team connecting councils in charge of topics including science and technology, communication network, intellectual property, health and medical strategy, space development, ocean policy to geospatial information.

Expanding beyond the previous industry-oriented focus, this second strategy aims to “specify the environment and measures conducive to effective future utilization of AI for the purposes of contributing to the solution of global issues through realization of Society 5.0 and overcoming the issues facing Japanese society”. At 74 pages long, the plan outlines targets ranging from education reform to R&D ecosystem, identifies development areas such as social use cases and data infrastructure, and highlights ethical issues.
