A prominent government-led AI use case that influences resource allocation for the Chinese public would be certain areas of AI utilization in China's Social Credit System.

China's Social Credit System (SCS) can be broadly understood as an ecosystem of digital scoring systems that classify behavior into morally "praise-" and "blameworthy"[^47]. Instead of one centralised scoring platform, there are currently multiple social credit systems across national, provincial, municipal, and ministerial levels, covering areas from judicial to financial and commercial credit rating and with varying degrees of public-private sector collaboration. While a clear unified structure is yet to be observed, the systems share core components:

-   all legal entities, including companies, are linked to a Unified Credit Code
-   all social credit systems involve a master database, a blacklisting and a punishment and rewards mechanism that may intersect policy areas

It is critical to point out that many of the social credit systems may or may not be currently using AI. China's AI Strategy, while emphasizing applying AI in social governance and public order, also did not explicitly mention the Social Credit System. However, while there are not sufficient public materials to precisely map out how many social credit systems across China are integrating which fields of AI technologies, an example relevant to our scope would be the use of facial recognition as one field of AI technology in maintaining public order within the framework of SCS.

Using facial recognition to targeting jaywalkers within a social credit system framework

-   In 2019, the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing introduced a to punish pedestrians who are captured on video more than five times in one year.[^48]
-   Facial recognition system was put in place at multiple busy in the city to identify jaywalkers. After being on camera, the image of the pedestrian will be matched with of drivers and demographic information to identify the . The facial recognition technology is advanced enough to identify Individuals wearing helmets, sunglasses, and masks.
-   Identified information about the offenders will be publicly on a screen beside the road. The punishment includes a to their social credit score, which could affect other of their daily lives, such as "assessments of their job , access to personal loans, and vehicle insurance "[^49].
