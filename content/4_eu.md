# European Union

Europe sets out to strike a balance between regulation and the free market, focused on strategic investments and regulation. The European Commission has increased its annual investments in AI by 70% under the research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 in order to:

1.  Connect and strengthen AI research centres across Europe.
2.  Support the development of an "AI-on-demand platform" that provides access to relevant AI resources in the EU for all users.
3.  Support the development of AI applications in key sectors.

However, this is only a small proportion of total investments, many of which come from Member States and the private sector. The Commission's actions act as the glue linking the individual efforts, with an aim to make a collective solid investment. The expected impact of such an investment is much greater than the sum of its parts. To this end, more actions are foreseen to:

1.  Increase the deployment and uptake of AI and robotics made in Europe by creating world reference large scale testing and experimentation facilities in key strategic sectors and technologies (agri-food, healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities and edge AI);
2.  Build on Public Private Partnerships;
3.  Accelerate public sector AI adoption by supporting public procurement of AI-based systems and helping to transform public procurement processes themselves.

Along the process citizens, experts and stakeholders have been able to provide direct input to the AI policy through ad hoc consultations and online discussions in the European AI Alliance.
